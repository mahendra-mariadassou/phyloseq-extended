compute_niche <- function(physeq, niche, freq = TRUE) {
  ## Args
  ## - physeq: phyloseq class object, otu abundances are extracted from this object
  ## - niche:  Either the a single character string matching a
  ##           variable name in the corresponding sample_data of ‘physeq’, or a
  ##           numeric vector with the same length as the number of samples in ‘physeq’.
  ## - freq    Logical. Should counts be replaced by frequencies (TRUE) or kept as such (FALSE).
  ##           Defaults to TRUE. TRUE corresponding to weighting all samples equally while FALSE
  ##           weights them with their library size. 
  ## 
  ## Returns;
  ## A named vector with the mean niche of all taxa. If a taxa is present in samples 1, ..., n with
  ##  relative abundances a[1], ..., a[n] and the samples have niche values v[1], ..., v[n], the mean niche is
  ##  given by sum(a * v)/sum(a). 
  ##
  ## Note:
  ## - all 0 vectors lead to undefined (NA) niche value
  ## 
  ## Returns
  ## - niche.value: named vector of mean niche value
